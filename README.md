# super_tiny_compiler-rustPort - WIP

A Rust port of the Go port (https://github.com/hazbo/the-super-tiny-compiler) of the Super Tiny Compiler Project
 https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler

Goal: To better understand compilers while continuing to advance in Rust.

I found the simple Lua interpreter in Rust that I think everyone has seen by now and I think this is a better starting point from the engineering pov as well as the language for those coming from a web or scripting background.

Eventual goal: To finish this while commenting the code well enough, use enough best practices / include enough good Rust documentation to make this a learn-rust-with-one-project for devs who haven't yet explored it.

Luckily there are several other Rust ports of the STC that are very well written, whom I will make sure to cite/source when this is finished. I am more focused on making sure the documentation / comments are as accurate and explicit as possible. There are great use cases for a lot of what makes rust awesome in a small project like this, so hopefully I can actually finish a side project for once.
